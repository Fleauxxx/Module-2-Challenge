# Module-2-Challenge
On this challenge i followed the acceptance criteria to produce and finish functional webage that is about me.
The page includes a porfolio of my work which i have none at the moment.
It also include my contact info as well as a resume.
By applying things that I have leared of the past few weeks I have constructed a pretty standard webpage.
The links are functional according the acceptance criteria
My color scheme matches.
I created a repository and made commits as i worked along.
